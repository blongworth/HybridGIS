# Why run gas instead of graphite?

Performance = currents counts stability efficiency time

### Benefits

- Skip a time-consuming reduction to graphite
- Eliminate blank associated with graphitization

### Challenges

- Ultimate precision is lower
- Lower currents/counts (time to precision)
- variability in blank (current dependent)
- variability in sample performance

# Inlet systems

### $$PV=nRT$$

AKA interfaces

Closed vs Open

Introduce steady, reproducible current as key to data quality

Dilution

Makes moving small amounts of gas easier by increasing pressure

Source doesn't care about helium as long as it gets its CO2
pumping issues

Gas delivered at set rate

For a given sample size:
* High inlet volume = low inlet pressure (NEC inlet)
* Low inlet volume = high inlet pressure (Ionplus inlet)


Smallest samples require minimizing inlet volume and pressure while maintaining good flow control

compare to first tests

Note that our flat-topped current curve allows variable flow of the vial system. MICADAS has a more pronounced peak so this may not work as well. (Check papers for peak shape)

Also note current dependent ratio (blank) as a complicating factor

# Results - blanks

Current/target dependent?
Constant blanks and currents allow single mass independent correction

Plot: ratio vs current for blanks and livegas

Idea: use data from dillution runs of live and dead gas to create curves

# MICADAS

source differences

# MICADAS - Carbonate method

inlet/method differences
* micadas uses closed system
* co2 from carbonates transferred onto resin trap in stream of he
* sample introduced by adding helium and adjusting flow using variable volume

More pronounced current vs. flow curve makes measurement more difficult at variable CO2 flow.
Salazar and Szidat are developing an open split interface with EA - squish peak with dead volume
